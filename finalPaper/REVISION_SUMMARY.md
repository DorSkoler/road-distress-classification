## Major Changes

### 1. ✅ Eliminated Chapter 8 (Experimental Evolution)
**Reviewer Concern:** "Chapter 8 reads more like a list (especially with the dates). This information should instead be incorporated into the previous sections."

**Resolution:** Completely removed Section 8 ("Experimental Evolution and Methodology") and integrated relevant content into appropriate earlier sections:

- **Integrated into Section 3.3 (Data Preparation Pipeline):** Road-based splitting methodology (June 2025)
- **Integrated into Section 3.4 (Model Architecture Exploration):** Five model variant descriptions with clear technical details (July 2025)
- **Integrated into Section 4.1 (Base Architecture):** Common architecture shared across variants
- **Integrated into Section 4.2 (Training Configuration):** Training hyperparameters and duration
- **Integrated into Section 6 (Discussion):** Key methodological insights

**Result:** Paper now follows standard academic structure (Introduction, Related Work, Dataset/Methodology, Architecture/Training, Results, Discussion, Conclusion) without dated bullet-point lists.

### 2. ✅ Clarified Technical Terminology

**Reviewer Concern:** "Some of the points are unclear — for example, Smart Data Splitting describes preventing data leakage... Model h refers to partial road masking as opposed to full, what does that mean? And there's a note that regions outside the road are weighted at 0.5 — what does that mean?"

**Resolution:**

#### 2.1 Road Segmentation Masks (Section 3.3)
**Before:** Vague references to "annotated boundaries" and "road masks"

**After:** Clear definition added at the start of Section 3.3:
> "Road segmentation masks are binary images indicating which pixels belong to the road surface versus background (vegetation, barriers, sky, etc.). These masks enabled mask-enhanced models to focus learning on road surface conditions while reducing the influence of irrelevant background features."

#### 2.2 Data Splitting (Section 3.4)
**Before:** Listed as separate achievement "Smart Data Splitting"

**After:** Integrated with clear rationale in Section 3.4:
> "To ensure realistic evaluation and prevent data leakage, we implemented road-based data splitting (June 2025). This approach ensures that all images from a single road appear in only one split (train, validation, or test), preventing the model from memorizing specific road characteristics that could artificially inflate performance metrics."

#### 2.3 Masking Strategies (Section 3.4)
**Before:** Unclear descriptions of "full" vs "partial" masking

**After:** Explicit technical definitions for each model:

- **Model A - Segmentation Only:** "Non-road pixels in the input image are set to zero (black) using the segmentation mask"
- **Model C - Full Masking:** "Non-road pixels zeroed out"
- **Model D - Partial Masking:** "Partial masking applies a 0.5 weight multiplier to non-road pixel intensities rather than zeroing them completely. This preserves some background context while emphasizing road regions."
- **Model H - CLAHE + Partial Masking:** "0.5 weight for non-road regions"

### 3. ✅ Added Comprehensive Model Comparison

**Reviewer Concern:** "Could you include the metrics of all the models that were compared? That would help clarify the differences."

**Resolution:** Added two comprehensive comparison tables in Section 5 (Results):

#### Table 1: Complete Model Variant Comparison
```
Model   | Augmentation | Masking  | CLAHE | Macro F1 | Time (h) | Epoch
--------|--------------|----------|-------|----------|----------|-------
Model A | No           | Full     | No    | 0.344    | 0.15     | 2
Model B | Yes          | None     | No    | 0.806    | 1.26     | 21
Model C | Yes          | Full     | No    | 0.787    | 1.31     | 21
Model D | Yes          | Partial  | No    | 0.789    | 1.41     | 23
Model H | Yes          | Partial  | Yes   | 0.781    | 2.99     | 37
```

#### Table 2: Detailed Per-Class Performance Analysis
Complete precision, recall, and F1 scores for all five models across all three classes (damage, occlusion, crop), with bold highlighting for best performance in each metric.

**Key metrics included:**
- Model A: 34.4% macro F1 (catastrophic failure with full masking, no augmentation)
- Model B: 80.6% macro F1 (best overall, augmentation only)
- Model C: 78.7% macro F1 (augmentation + full masking)
- Model D: 78.9% macro F1 (augmentation + partial masking)
- Model H: 78.1% macro F1 (augmentation + partial masking + CLAHE)

### 4. ✅ Added Explicit Discussion of Segmentation Paradox

**Reviewer Concern:** "It's quite unintuitive that one of the leading models, model b, doesn't use a segmentation mask while another one does. Is there any explanation for this phenomenon?"

**Resolution:** Added entirely new Section 5.3: "Critical Finding: Context Matters More Than Segmentation"

This comprehensive analysis includes:

#### Performance Gap Analysis
- Model A (full masking, no augmentation): 34.4% F1 — catastrophic failure
- Model C (full masking + augmentation): 78.7% F1 — 1.9 points below Model B
- Model D (partial masking + augmentation): 78.9% F1 — 1.7 points below Model B
- Model B (no masking + augmentation): **80.6% F1** — best performance

#### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Background Context Provides Critical Information:** Environmental context (road edges, surrounding terrain, lighting) aids classification
2. **Full Masking Creates Information Bottleneck:** Zeroing non-road pixels eliminates context needed for occlusion and crop detection
3. **Partial Masking Offers Marginal Improvement:** Still underperforms pure image-based learning
4. **Data Augmentation is Essential:** Model A (34.4%) vs Model C (78.7%) shows augmentation matters more than masking

#### Why Model H Remains Valuable
Despite lower F1, Model H provides:
- Enhanced edge detection via CLAHE
- Complementary error patterns
- Highest occlusion precision (81.7%)
- Highest crop precision (97.4%)

### 5. ✅ Documented Scoring System Selection and Validation

**Reviewer Concern:** "The principle by which the scoring of entire roads is performed seems relatively complex and involves several parameters. How were the criterion and parameters selected? Was any evaluation performed to verify that this criterion is indeed useful?"

**Resolution:** Expanded Section 6.2.2 with entirely new subsection: "Penalty Hierarchy Rationale and Selection Process"

#### Parameter Selection Methodology
1. **Operational Impact Hierarchy:** Damage (-75) > Occlusion (-20) > Crop (-5) based on maintenance requirements
2. **Class Frequency Calibration:** Penalty values calibrated for class imbalance (32.9% / 19.1% / 4.3%)
3. **Score Range Preservation:** Maximum penalties sum to 100 points ensuring full dynamic range

#### Design Rationale
- Dynamic confidence scaling provides fine-grained granularity
- Threshold integration ensures penalties align with classification decisions
- Balanced multi-factor assessment prevents single-class domination

#### Validation Approach (Honest Limitations)
Acknowledged that formal validation with maintenance records was beyond project scope, but documented:
- Monotonicity validation (higher confidence → lower scores)
- Boundary condition testing (perfect=100, maximally distressed=0)
- Rank ordering validation via manual inspection
- Sensitivity analysis of alternative penalty weights

**Critically:** Added to Limitations section:
> "The road health scoring system parameters were selected based on domain expertise and design principles but lack formal validation against ground-truth maintenance prioritization decisions or established pavement condition indices (e.g., PCI, IRI). Future work should validate the scoring system against real-world maintenance records."

### 6. ✅ Improved Visualizations and Captions

**Reviewer Concern:** "There's no real value in plotting the thresholds you defined — the comparison between thresholds isn't very informative."

**Resolution:** Enhanced figure captions to explain *why* visualizations matter:

#### Figure: Threshold Strategies Comparison (updated caption)
**Before:** Generic description
**After:** 
> "Operational threshold strategies showing precision-recall trade-offs for different deployment scenarios. The balanced strategy (damage=0.50, occlusion=0.40, crop=0.49) provides optimal performance for general monitoring, while high-recall and high-precision modes enable specialized use cases such as comprehensive audits or automated maintenance triggering."

#### Figure: Threshold Optimization Analysis (updated caption)
**Before:** Generic description
**After:**
> "Per-class precision-recall curves demonstrating the rationale for different optimal thresholds. Damage detection (τ=0.50) maintains precision-recall balance, occlusion detection (τ=0.40) captures subtle environmental factors with high precision, and crop detection (τ=0.49) achieves exceptional precision while maintaining strong recall. The varying optimal operating points reflect fundamental differences in class separability and operational requirements."

- "Full masking" = non-road pixels set to zero
- "Partial masking" = non-road pixels weighted at 0.5
- "CLAHE" = Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (always spelled out first use)

### 3. Timeline Integration
All dated activities (April-August 2025) now integrated contextually without bullet-point lists:
- April-May: Mask generation and annotation
- June: Road-based data splitting
- July: Model variant training
- August: Threshold optimization (mentioned in Results)
