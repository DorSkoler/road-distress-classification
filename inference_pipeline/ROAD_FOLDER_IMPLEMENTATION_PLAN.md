# Road Folder Upload & Visualization Implementation Plan

## 📋 Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding a third processing mode to the road distress classification UI: **Road Folder Upload**. This feature will allow users to upload entire folders of road images with GPS coordinates, classify the entire road, generate an overall road health score, and visualize the results on an interactive map.

## 🎯 Current State Analysis

### Existing UI Structure (app.py)
- ✅ **Single Image Mode**: Upload and analyze one image
- ✅ **Batch Processing Mode**: Upload multiple images independently  
- ❌ **Road Folder Mode**: Missing - needs implementation

### Current Processing Pipeline
- ✅ Multi-model ensemble (Model B + Model H)
- ✅ Individual image classification
- ✅ Grad-CAM visualization generation
- ✅ Confidence heatmaps
- ❌ Coordinate-based road reconstruction
- ❌ Road-level scoring system

## 🚀 New Feature Requirements

### 1. Image Format & Parsing
**Input Format**: `{sequence_number}_{longitude}_{latitude}.png`
- Example: `001_31.296905_-97.543646.png`
- Need to parse coordinates from filename
- Handle sequence ordering for road reconstruction

### 2. Road Scoring System (0-100)
**Scoring Logic**:
- **100**: Perfect road (no damage, occlusion, or crop issues)
- **0**: Completely damaged road
- **Penalty System**:
  - Damage detection: -30 to -50 points per image (weighted by confidence)
  - Occlusion: -10 to -20 points per image (uncertainty penalty)
  - Crop issues: -5 to -15 points per image (data quality penalty)
  - Final score: Weighted average across all road segments

### 3. Interactive Road Visualization
**Requirements**:
- Geographic map using coordinates
- Zoomable and pannable interface
- Grad-CAM overlays on road segments
- Color-coded road health indicators
- Road sequence visualization

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Files to Modify/Create)

```

#### 2.2 Road Health Scoring Algorithm

**Scoring Components**:

    'high': -20,     # Can't assess road condition
    'medium': -10,   # Partial obstruction
    'low': -5        # Minor obstruction
}

CROP_PENALTY = {
    'high': -15,     # Poor image quality
    'medium': -8,    # Some quality issues
    'low': -3        # Minor issues
}

def calculate_segment_score(predictions: dict) -> float:
    """Calculate score for individual road segment."""
