## Model Improvements and Updates

### Changes Made (Date: [Current Date])

1. Model Architecture Updates:
   - Added configurable dropout rate (default: 0.5)
   - Added dropout before the first linear layer
   - Made dropout rate consistent across both EfficientNet and ResNet backbones

2. Training Configuration Updates:
   - Reduced learning rate from 0.001 to 0.0005 for more stable training
   - Increased weight decay from 1e-4 to 0.01 for better regularization
   - Implemented CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts scheduler with:
     - T_0 = 10 epochs (restart interval)
     - T_mult = 2 (doubling restart interval)
     - eta_min = 1e-6 (minimum learning rate)

3. Data Augmentation Enhancements:
   - Increased color jitter parameters:
     - Brightness: 0.2 → 0.3
     - Contrast: 0.2 → 0.3
     - Saturation: 0.2 → 0.3
   - Enhanced geometric transformations:
     - Rotation range: 10° → 15°
     - Translation range: (0.1, 0.1) → (0.15, 0.15)
     - Scale range: (0.9, 1.1) → (0.8, 1.2)
   - Improved random erasing:
     - Probability: 0.3 → 0.5
     - Added ratio parameter: (0.3, 3.3)

### Expected Impact
These changes are expected to:
1. Reduce overfitting through stronger regularization
2. Improve model generalization with more diverse augmentations
3. Provide more stable training with adjusted learning rate
4. Allow better exploration of the loss landscape with the new scheduler

### Next Training Steps
To run the training with these updates:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision tqdm numpy sklearn matplotlib seaborn
```

2. Run the training script:
```bash
python src/train.py
```

3. Monitor the training progress in the experiment directory:
   - Check metrics in `experiments/efficientnet_b3_enhanced_[timestamp]/metrics.json`
   - View model checkpoints in the same directory
   - Monitor validation accuracy for early stopping

4. After training completes:
   - Evaluate the model on the test set
   - Compare results with previous experiments
   - Analyze the impact of the changes
