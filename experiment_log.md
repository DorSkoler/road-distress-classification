## Model Improvements and Updates

### Changes Made (Date: [Current Date])

1. Model Architecture Updates:
   - Added configurable dropout rate (default: 0.5)
   - Added dropout before the first linear layer
   - Made dropout rate consistent across both EfficientNet and ResNet backbones

2. Training Configuration Updates:
   - Reduced learning rate from 0.001 to 0.0005 for more stable training
   - Increased weight decay from 1e-4 to 0.01 for better regularization
   - Implemented CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts scheduler with:
     - T_0 = 10 epochs (restart interval)
     - T_mult = 2 (doubling restart interval)
     - eta_min = 1e-6 (minimum learning rate)

3. Data Augmentation Enhancements:
   - Increased color jitter parameters:
     - Brightness: 0.2 → 0.3
     - Contrast: 0.2 → 0.3
     - Saturation: 0.2 → 0.3
   - Enhanced geometric transformations:
     - Rotation range: 10° → 15°
     - Translation range: (0.1, 0.1) → (0.15, 0.15)
     - Scale range: (0.9, 1.1) → (0.8, 1.2)
   - Improved random erasing:
     - Probability: 0.3 → 0.5
     - Added ratio parameter: (0.3, 3.3)

### Expected Impact
These changes are expected to:
1. Reduce overfitting through stronger regularization
2. Improve model generalization with more diverse augmentations
3. Provide more stable training with adjusted learning rate
4. Allow better exploration of the loss landscape with the new scheduler

### Next Training Steps
To run the training with these updates:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install torch torchvision tqdm numpy sklearn matplotlib seaborn
```

2. Run the training script:
```bash
python src/train.py
```

3. Monitor the training progress in the experiment directory:
   - Check metrics in `experiments/efficientnet_b3_enhanced_[timestamp]/metrics.json`
   - View model checkpoints in the same directory
   - Monitor validation accuracy for early stopping

4. After training completes:
   - Evaluate the model on the test set
   - Compare results with previous experiments
   - Analyze the impact of the changes

### Performance Comparison with Previous Runs
| Metric | Run 1 | Run 2 | Run 3 | Improvement (vs Run 2) |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|----------------------|
| Best Val Acc | 81.35% | 89.16% | 85.31% | -3.85% |
| Final Val Acc | 80.80% | 86.52% | 84.32% | -2.20% |

| Validation Loss | 0.2555 | 0.2015 | 7.2415 | - |

### Issues Identified
1. Early Stopping Triggered Too Soon:
   - Model was still showing improvement in validation accuracy
   - Loss spikes in epochs 6 and 7 might have been temporary

2. Training Instability:
   - Large validation loss spikes observed
   - Training accuracy was still improving when stopped

3. Learning Rate Schedule:
   - No warmup period implemented
   - Sudden learning rate changes might have contributed to instability

## Recent Changes (27.04. - Second Update)

### Training Configuration Updates
1. Early Stopping:
   - Increased patience from 5 to 10 epochs
   - This will give the model more time to recover from temporary performance dips

2. Gradient Management:
   - Added gradient clipping with value of 1.0
   - This should prevent the large loss spikes observed in epochs 6 and 7

3. Learning Rate Schedule:
   - Implemented 5-epoch warmup period
   - Switched from CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts to:
     - Linear warmup (0.001 to 1.0) for first 5 epochs
     - Followed by CosineAnnealingLR for remaining epochs
   - This should provide more stable initial training

### Expected Impact
These changes should:
1. Allow the model to train longer and potentially reach better performance
2. Prevent gradient explosions and stabilize training
3. Provide smoother learning rate transitions
4. Help the model better handle the initial training phase

### Next Training Steps
1. Run the training script with new configurations:
```bash
python src/train.py
```

2. Monitor for:
   - More stable validation loss
   - Longer training duration
   - Better final performance
   - Smoother learning rate transitions

3. After training:
   - Compare results with previous runs
   - Analyze the impact of gradient clipping
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of the warmup period
