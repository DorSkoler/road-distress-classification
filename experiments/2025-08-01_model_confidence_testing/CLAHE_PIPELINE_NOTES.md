# CLAHE Preprocessing Pipeline - Implementation Notes

**Date**: August 1, 2025  
**Issue Resolved**: Model H now properly applies CLAHE preprocessing during inference

## Problem Identified

Originally, our confidence testing script was feeding **raw images** to both Model B and Model H. However:

- **Model B** was trained on raw images ✅
- **Model H** was trained on **CLAHE-enhanced images** ❌ (we were giving it raw images)

This created a **train/test mismatch** for Model H, severely impacting its performance.

## Solution Implemented

### 🔧 **CLAHE Preprocessing Pipeline**

1. **Load CLAHE Parameters**: 18,173 optimized parameters from `clahe_params.json`
2. **Image-Specific Enhancement**: Each test image gets its optimized CLAHE parameters
3. **LAB Color Space Processing**: Apply CLAHE to lightness channel only
4. **Model-Aware Processing**: Only apply to models that use CLAHE (E, F, G, H)

### 📊 **Performance Impact**

**Before Fix (Raw images for both models):**
- Model H: 40% overall accuracy, low confidence scores

**After Fix (CLAHE for Model H, Raw for Model B):**
- Model H: **60% overall accuracy** (+20 percentage points!)
- Model H Occlusion: **95.3% average confidence** (extremely high!)

## Technical Implementation

```python
def uses_clahe(self, variant: str) -> bool:
    """Check if a model variant uses CLAHE preprocessing."""
    clahe_variants = ['model_e', 'model_f', 'model_g', 'model_h']
    return variant in clahe_variants

def apply_clahe(self, image: np.ndarray, image_path: str) -> np.ndarray:
    """Apply CLAHE enhancement to image."""
    # 1. Extract image key for CLAHE params lookup
    # 2. Apply optimized CLAHE parameters 
    # 3. Process in LAB color space
    # 4. Return enhanced BGR image
```

## Key Validation Points

✅ **CLAHE params loaded**: "✓ Loaded CLAHE parameters for 18173 images"  
✅ **Model B uses raw**: "→ Using raw image for Model_B"  
✅ **Model H uses CLAHE**: "→ Applying CLAHE preprocessing for Model_H"  
✅ **Performance improved**: Model H confidence scores dramatically increased

## Critical Learning

**Always ensure test preprocessing matches training preprocessing!**

This is especially important for:
- CLAHE-enhanced models (E, F, G, H)
- Augmented models (when testing with specific augmentations)
- Any models with custom preprocessing pipelines

## File Changes

- `test_model_confidence.py`: Added CLAHE preprocessing pipeline
- `README.md`: Updated with proper performance metrics
- `EXPERIMENT_SUMMARY.md`: Corrected results with CLAHE preprocessing

*This fix ensures Model H receives the same CLAHE-enhanced input during testing that it was trained on.*
