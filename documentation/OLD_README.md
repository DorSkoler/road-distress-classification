# Road Distress Classification Pipeline using Aerial Imagery

## Context & Literature Review

**Deep Learning for Pavement Distress:** Traditional road inspection relied on manual surveys or simple image processing (edge detectors, thresholding) that struggled with diverse defect shapes and lighting ([Automated Road Defect and Anomaly Detection for Traffic Safety: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5656#:~:text=defects%20using%20region,in%20detecting)) ([

Modern CNN-based models (e.g. ResNet, DenseNet, EfficientNet) excel at learning the subtle textures of road damage when sufficient data is available ([Automated Road Defect and Anomaly Detection for Traffic Safety: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5656#:~:text=The%20selection%20of%20the%20appropriate,improve%20with%20more%20data%20and)) ([Automated Road Defect and Anomaly Detection for Traffic Safety: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5656#:~:text=Neural%20networks%E2%80%99%20complexity%20increases%20with,computing%20resources%20for%20data%20processing)). For instance, an EfficientNet-B4 encoder in a segmentation model achieved ~98% crack detection accuracy on a thermal-RGB pavement dataset ([Automated Road Defect and Anomaly Detection for Traffic Safety: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5656#:~:text=The%20pixel%20segmentation%20method%20for,are%20divided%20into%20decoder%20and)). **Vision Transformers (ViT)** and hybrid models are also emerging in this domain. A lightweight Transformer Patch Labeling Network (LTPLN) was proposed to partition images into patches and classify pavement “disease” with high efficiency ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11466381/#:~:text=this%20paper%20proposes%20a%20novel,is%20introduced%20into%20the%20Transformer)) ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11466381/#:~:text=quality,locate%20the%20positions%20of%20pavement)) ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11466381/#:~:text=to%20the%20baseline%20model%2C%20the,world%20scenarios)). Similarly, Swin Transformer modules have been integrated into crack detection models to better capture long thin cracks with self-attention across image patches ([USSC-YOLO: Enhanced Multi-Scale Road Crack Object Detection Algorithm for UAV Image](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/17/5586#:~:text=,reducing%20missed%20and%20false%20detections)).

**Detection vs. Segmentation Approaches:** Deep learning models tackle road distress at different granularities. *Image-level classification* treats a whole image or large tile as “damaged vs. undamaged,” useful for quick screening ([
            LTPLN: Automatic pavement distress detection - PMC
        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11466381/#:~:text=Current%20methods%20for%20pavement%20disease,We%20term%20this)) but potentially missing small localized defects. *Patch-wise classification* breaks the road into smaller segments (patches) and classifies each, providing more localized insight while using classification networks ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11466381/#:~:text=this%20paper%20proposes%20a%20novel,is%20introduced%20into%20the%20Transformer)) ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11466381/#:~:text=quality,Experimental%20results%20demonstrate%20that%20compared)). *Object detection* methods (e.g. YOLO, Faster R-CNN) aim to localize and classify specific defects like potholes with bounding boxes. The YOLO family in particular is popular for real-time road defect detection due to its speed and accuracy ([Road manhole cover defect detection via multi-scale edge enhancement and feature aggregation pyramid | Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-95450-8#:~:text=series4%20%2C%2028%2C6%20%2C%2030%2C8,road%20manhole%20cover%20detection%20applications)). Improved versions (YOLOv5/v7/v8) have been customized for road damage – for example, YOLOv8-Pothole detectors and RDD-YOLO variants significantly improve small defect detection in complex backgrounds ([RDD-YOLO: Road Damage Detection Algorithm Based on Improved ...](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/8/3360#:~:text=RDD,YOLO)) ([YOLO-RD: A Road Damage Detection Method for Effective ...](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11902777/#:~:text=YOLO,improvement%20in%20small%20object)). However, purely using bounding boxes can be limiting for irregular cracks; a survey noted that object detection with boxes may have “limited usability” for fine-grained road anomalies ([Automated Road Defect and Anomaly Detection for Traffic Safety: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5656#:~:text=segmentation%20process,road%20roughness%20estimation%2C%20and%20potential)). *Segmentation-based methods* predict pixel-level masks of damage and are considered the gold-standard for fine detail ([Automated Road Defect and Anomaly Detection for Traffic Safety: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5656#:~:text=The%20pixel%20segmentation%20method%20for,are%20divided%20into%20decoder%20and)) ([Automated Road Defect and Anomaly Detection for Traffic Safety: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5656#:~:text=of%20every%20pixel%20identified%20within,road%20roughness%20estimation%2C%20and%20potential)). Variants of U-Net and FCN have been applied to segment cracks with high fidelity ([](https://elib.dlr.de/185780/1/ISPRS_Congress_2022___Full_Paper__Road_Condition_Assessment_final.pdf#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20we%20generated%20a,INTRODUCTION)) ([](https://elib.dlr.de/185780/1/ISPRS_Congress_2022___Full_Paper__Road_Condition_Assessment_final.pdf#:~:text=thickness%20of%20our%20objects,smooth%20loss%20can%20support%20the)). For example, Merkle *et al.* (2022) used a Dense U-Net to segment thin cracks and “working seams” (sealed joints) in aerial images (~10 cm/pixel), successfully extracting these fine features from overhead imagery ([](https://elib.dlr.de/185780/1/ISPRS_Congress_2022___Full_Paper__Road_Condition_Assessment_final.pdf#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20we%20generated%20a,INTRODUCTION)) ([](https://elib.dlr.de/185780/1/ISPRS_Congress_2022___Full_Paper__Road_Condition_Assessment_final.pdf#:~:text=thickness%20of%20our%20objects,smooth%20loss%20can%20support%20the)). Segmentation provides rich information (shape, length of cracks), but requires detailed annotations and more computation. A compromise is two-stage approaches: first detect or classify regions containing damage, then segment within those regions ([A Deep Learning Framework for Segmentation of Road Defects ...](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3652037.3663935#:~:text=pixel,and%20potholes)) ([Deep learning-based concrete defects classification and detection ...](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14759217231168212#:~:text=,As)). For instance, one study first classified image patches as cracked or not, then applied a Mask R-CNN on positive patches to delineate the crack shape ([(PDF) A Deep Learning-Based Approach for Road Surface Damage ...](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/363020704_A_Deep_Learning-Based_Approach_for_Road_Surface_Damage_Detection#:~:text=%28PDF%29%20A%20Deep%20Learning,for%20identifying%20defects%20of)).

**Aerial and Satellite Imagery Studies:** Early deep learning work focused on ground-level images (smartphone or dashcam photos) ([[PDF] Road Damage Detection and Classification with YOLOv7](https://phamvanvung.github.io/publications/pham2022road.pdf#:~:text=,BigData%202022%2C%20and%20yield)). Now, **aerial and satellite imagery** are gaining attention for large-scale road monitoring. High-resolution satellite images (e.g. 0.3 m GSD) have enabled detecting even small road damages after disasters ([

Zhang *et al.* (2024) introduced **CAU-RoadDamage**, the first dataset of high-res satellite images with pixel-level road damage labels ([
Segment-anything embedding for pixel-level road damage extraction using high-resolution satellite images – DOAJ](https://doaj.org/article/685634315fba4490b5cee0fed97c185c#:~:text=with%20blurry%20boundaries%2C%20versatile%20sizes%2C,art)). They fine-tuned a foundation segmentation model (Segment Anything Model, **SAM**) to this task, achieving an F1 of 76% in identifying damaged road pixels ([

This demonstrated the feasibility of satellite-based road damage mapping, though challenges like blurry damage boundaries and varied damage scales were noted ([
Segment-anything embedding for pixel-level road damage extraction using high-resolution satellite images – DOAJ](https://doaj.org/article/685634315fba4490b5cee0fed97c185c#:~:text=post,way%20attention%20is)). **UAV (drone) imagery** offers even higher resolution and flexibility. Zhang *et al.* (2022) designed a multi-level attention CNN for UAV images, which improved focus on subtle cracks amid complex backgrounds ([Road damage detection using UAV images based on multi-level ...](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/8637bb0af17ff6699e7912fd51c32c9597085c27#:~:text=,Published%20in%20Automation%20in)). Others have applied object detectors on drone images to find potholes and cracks; e.g. a YOLOv5s-based model (USSC-YOLO) was tailored for UAV crack detection by integrating a Swin Transformer and coordinate attention to boost sensitivity to tiny cracks ([USSC-YOLO: Enhanced Multi-Scale Road Crack Object Detection Algorithm for UAV Image](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/17/5586#:~:text=a%20novel%20lightweight%20road%20crack,study%20are%20summarized%20as%20follows)). These works show deep models can generalize to aerial views, but require coping with unique issues like variable scales and cluttered scenes (cars, markings, shadows).

**Key Challenges:** Road distress detection in aerial imagery faces several challenges. **Occlusions** are a major issue – overhead images often show vehicles, tree canopies, or shadows partially covering the road surface. Such occlusions can hide cracks or confuse the model. For example, manhole detection research noted that lighting and occlusion by dirt or objects complicate detection ([Road manhole cover defect detection via multi-scale edge enhancement and feature aggregation pyramid | Scientific Reports](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-95450-8#:~:text=cover%20detection%20presents%20several%20challenges,additional%20challenges%20for%20feature%20extraction)). A general road anomaly survey likewise lists *“shadows, occlusions, and camera resolution limitations”* as factors that degrade performance ([Automated Road Defect and Anomaly Detection for Traffic Safety: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5656#:~:text=match%20at%20L2524%20shadow%2C%20occlusions%2C,merging%20long%2Fshort%20bump%20classes%20to)). Models may misidentify shadows or oil stains as cracks if not properly trained ([Automated Road Defect and Anomaly Detection for Traffic Safety: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5656#:~:text=match%20at%20L2376%20shadows%20being,for%20crack%20detection%20The%20model)). **Figure 1** below illustrates some of these challenges: different crack scales, and an example (f) where a tree’s shadow partially obscures cracks on the pavement.

 ([USSC-YOLO: Enhanced Multi-Scale Road Crack Object Detection Algorithm for UAV Image](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/17/5586)) *Examples of road distress in aerial images (UNFSRCI UAV dataset samples). Subfigures (a–d) show cracks at various scales (red boxes) from close-up to distant views. (e) shows an intact road (no cracks), and (f) shows cracks on a road partly occluded by a tree shadow, illustrating the challenge of occlusion in damage detection ([USSC-YOLO: Enhanced Multi-Scale Road Crack Object Detection Algorithm for UAV Image](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/17/5586#:~:text=Image%3A%20Sensors%2024%2005586%20g001)) ([USSC-YOLO: Enhanced Multi-Scale Road Crack Object Detection Algorithm for UAV Image](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/17/5586#:~:text=Figure%201,road%20with%20tree%20shadows%20disturbing)).*

Other challenges include **Lighting and Weather Variability**: Aerial surveys might be conducted under different sun angles or weather conditions, causing varying illumination, shadows, or wet road surfaces. Reflections or glare can mimic distress or wash out fine cracks ([Automated Road Defect and Anomaly Detection for Traffic Safety: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5656#:~:text=match%20at%20L2239%20accuracy%20than,31%5D%20Debris%20object)) ([Automated Road Defect and Anomaly Detection for Traffic Safety: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5656#:~:text=accuracy%20than%20professional%20equipment%20and,31%5D%20Debris%20object)). **Road Texture Diversity** is another factor – asphalt, concrete, and composite roads have different color/texture, and distress manifestations (e.g. concrete may spall differently than asphalt cracking). A model trained on one surface type may not directly transfer to another without adaptation. **Class Imbalance** is typically severe: the vast majority of road surface is undamaged, with relatively few damaged areas (especially for early-stage cracks). This imbalance can bias classifiers to predict “undamaged” frequently, missing true distress ([Automated Road Defect and Anomaly Detection for Traffic Safety: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5656#:~:text=Limitations%3A%20The%20small%20size%20of,14%20Road%20infrastructure%20defect%20dataset)). Techniques like data augmentation, focused sampling, or loss weighting are needed to ensure rare damage examples are learned ([Automated Road Defect and Anomaly Detection for Traffic Safety: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5656#:~:text=Limitations%3A%20The%20small%20size%20of,14%20Road%20infrastructure%20defect%20dataset)). Finally, there are **resolution trade-offs** – high-resolution imagery (drone, ~cm level) can reveal tiny cracks but covers small areas, whereas satellite images cover large regions but might only detect larger potholes or road breakup. Many studies now combine algorithms with **multi-scale attention** or image pyramids to handle both micro-cracks and larger defects in one framework ([USSC-YOLO: Enhanced Multi-Scale Road Crack Object Detection Algorithm for UAV Image](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/17/5586#:~:text=Accurately%20identifying%20tiny%20cracks%20poses,contrario%20decision%20criterion%2C%20which%20enhances)) ([USSC-YOLO: Enhanced Multi-Scale Road Crack Object Detection Algorithm for UAV Image](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/17/5586#:~:text=a%20novel%20lightweight%20road%20crack,study%20are%20summarized%20as%20follows)). Despite these challenges, the literature shows a clear trend towards accurate, automated road distress mapping using deep learning, combining innovations in model architecture with robust data handling to cope with real-world complexities.

## Dataset & Preprocessing

**Dataset Exploration:** The project begins with understanding the provided aerial road imagery dataset. It likely consists of overhead images of road segments labeled as *“damaged,” “undamaged,” “occluded,”* or *“cropped”* per segment. A crucial first step is to perform exploratory data analysis on these labels. Calculate the label distribution – for example, how many segments fall into each category. Often, **class imbalance** will be apparent (e.g. far more undamaged segments than damaged ones, and occluded/cropped might be relatively few). If the imbalance is extreme, one might plan strategies like oversampling damaged segments or using weighted loss functions ([Automated Road Defect and Anomaly Detection for Traffic Safety: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5656#:~:text=Limitations%3A%20The%20small%20size%20of,14%20Road%20infrastructure%20defect%20dataset)). Next, inspect sample images and labels for **consistency**. It’s important to verify that the labeling is reliable: e.g., ensure that segments labeled “damaged” indeed contain cracks or potholes, and that “occluded” segments correspond to visible obstructions (vehicles, shadows). Sometimes manual spot-checking or visualizing a batch of segments with their labels can reveal mislabels (e.g. a segment might be labeled undamaged despite a crack, or something marked occluded when the obstruction is minimal). Identifying any **noisy or missing labels** is key – if some segments have uncertain labels, one might either correct them (if ground truth is available) or exclude them from training to avoid confusion.

**Label Definitions:** Clarifying the criteria for *occluded* vs *cropped* is important. Likely, *“occluded”* means the road surface in that segment is largely not visible due to an object or shadow, and *“cropped”* means the segment is cut off by the image boundary (not fully captured). During preprocessing, one should apply these definitions consistently. For example, one could set a threshold: if >50% of the road area in a segment is covered by a foreign object (car, tree canopy) or heavy shadow, label it occluded; if a segment lies on the edge of an image such that part of the road extends outside the image, label it cropped. Ensuring consistency in these labels (possibly relabeling some segments if needed) will help the model learn the intended categories.

**Data Augmentation:** To address limited data and variability, a comprehensive augmentation pipeline is recommended. *Photometric augmentations* like random brightness and contrast adjustments will simulate different lighting conditions (e.g. dim overcast vs bright sun) so the model is robust to time-of-day and weather changes. Slight color jitter can account for camera or seasonal differences in road color tone. One can also simulate **occlusions** to an extent – for example, using cutout or mixup techniques to overlay shapes on training images, mimicking occluding objects. This could involve pasting random shadows or vehicle-like blobs onto road segments during training so that the model learns to identify when it cannot see the road. *Geometric augmentations* are also useful: rotations (90°, 45° etc.) and flips can help because aerial imagery has no canonical orientation – cracks can run any direction, and roads may curve. Care must be taken to keep labels aligned; for segmentation masks or tiled labels, apply the same transform to labels. If the dataset includes large aerial photos that get tiled into segments, one should also augment at the tile level (ensuring the crack pattern and label remain correct after transformation). As an example, researchers performed augmentations such as adding salt-and-pepper noise, rotations, and blurring on road images to enrich a training set ([USSC-YOLO: Enhanced Multi-Scale Road Crack Object Detection Algorithm for UAV Image](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/17/5586#:~:text=Image%3A%20Sensors%2024%2005586%20g002)). These operations improved model robustness to various distortions. We can adopt similar augmentations: adding Gaussian noise (to simulate sensor noise or compression artifacts), and blur (to emulate motion blur or focus issues). Figure 2 from a related work shows such augmentations – adding noise, rotating the image, blurring, etc. ([USSC-YOLO: Enhanced Multi-Scale Road Crack Object Detection Algorithm for UAV Image](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/17/5586#:~:text=Image%3A%20Sensors%2024%2005586%20g002)) – all of which can be mirrored in our pipeline.

**Road Segmentation & Tiling:** Since the data is aerial, each image may cover a substantial area with varying content. A prudent preprocessing step is to isolate the **road region** in each image. This can be done via a segmentation model or simple masks if provided. For instance, one could leverage the **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** to obtain a mask of the road surface by providing a few prompt points along the road ([
Segment-anything embedding for pixel-level road damage extraction using high-resolution satellite images – DOAJ](https://doaj.org/article/685634315fba4490b5cee0fed97c185c#:~:text=application%20of%20a%20pre,models%20for%20downstream%20remote%20sensing)). Having a binary mask for road vs background for each image allows focusing analysis only on road pixels, ignoring buildings, grass, etc. Once the road is isolated, the image can be **tiled** into smaller segments (if not already segmented). Tiling ensures high resolution input to the model and assigns each tile a label. Here, consistency is key: if a road defect lies on the border of two tiles, one must ensure it’s either captured fully in one or both tiles have appropriate labels (this is a minor issue if tiles overlap or if cracks are mostly smaller than a tile). If ground truth labeling was done on the original images (e.g. as polylines for cracks or polygons for potholes), we need to **propagate labels to tiles**. For example, if any portion of a crack annotation falls inside a tile, that tile should be labeled “damaged.” Conversely, a tile should be “undamaged” only if no part of any damage annotation is in it. Occlusion labels might be determined by separate annotation (e.g. perhaps the dataset provider labeled tiles with occlusion if they visually saw an occlusion). If not, we could programmatically determine occlusion by checking the presence of known occluding objects: one approach is to run a detector for cars/trees on the images to flag tiles containing such objects on the road. Another simpler heuristic is analyzing the color/texture – a large dark blob or distinct non-road texture on a road tile could indicate a shadow or object. These approaches can complement the given labels.

**Dealing with Occluded/Cropped Segments:** We must decide how to use occluded and cropped segments during training. One strategy is to include them as two additional classes (as given) in a multi-class classification. This teaches the model to recognize when it **cannot confidently assess** a segment due to obstruction or incomplete data. However, including these classes means the model’s feature focus might shift – e.g. it might learn to detect the presence of a vehicle (to predict “occluded”) which could be orthogonal to detecting cracks. An alternative is to treat occlusion/crop handling as a separate pre-processing step: for example, identify occluded segments via an external method and simply skip or mask them out in the classification stage (essentially an “ignore” label). An ablation experiment can be planned (as noted later) to compare these approaches. In practice, we might initially include them as classes (since they are part of the taxonomy) and ensure the training data has enough examples of each so the classifier learns them. If “occluded” or “cropped” are too sparse, we might generate more examples via augmentation (e.g. artificially crop some training tiles, or overlay objects as mentioned). For **train/val/test split**, it is critical to **prevent leakage** of road identity between sets. Since adjacent segments on the same road will have correlated conditions, we should split at the road level: entire roads (or images) assigned to either train, validation or test. This way, the model is evaluated on completely unseen roads. A spatial split can be done if the data covers multiple regions – e.g. use certain geographic areas for testing. This strategy mirrors the approach by Merkle *et al.*, who ensured that aerial images in their training, validation, and test sets were from distinct, non-overlapping locations ([](https://elib.dlr.de/185780/1/ISPRS_Congress_2022___Full_Paper__Road_Condition_Assessment_final.pdf#:~:text=match%20at%20L259%20in%20Figure,quite%20close%20in%20the%20figure)). A similar GIS-based split will improve the assessment of generalization to new areas.

## Modeling Approach

**Baseline Segment-Level Classifiers:** As a starting point, we can train a CNN to classify individual road segments (tiles) into the four categories. A **ResNet-50** backbone is a strong baseline for image classification, given its proven performance and moderate size. Pretrained on ImageNet, ResNet features can readily transfer to detecting cracks (which often manifest as line textures) ([Automated Road Defect and Anomaly Detection for Traffic Safety: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5656#:~:text=Due%20to%20their%20high%20efficiency,as%20different%20target%20anomaly%20types)). Another excellent choice is **EfficientNet**, which achieves high accuracy with fewer parameters by optimizing depth/width resolution scaling. These models accept a fixed-size input (e.g. 224×224 or 256×256 pixel segment) and output a class prediction. We would likely frame this as a 4-class classification (damaged, undamaged, occluded, cropped) from the outset. If initial experiments show confusion between damaged vs occluded (for example), we could pivot to a hierarchical scheme (first detect occlusion, else classify damage). But assuming sufficient data for all classes, a single-stage multi-class classifier can be trained with a softmax output. During training, techniques to handle imbalance can be applied: e.g. use a higher weight for the “damaged” class in the loss function or sample more damaged tiles per batch. Metrics like categorical accuracy are less informative in an imbalanced case, so we’ll pay attention to per-class precision/recall (more in Evaluation section).

**Handling “Occluded” and “Cropped” in Modeling:** There are two main strategies. **(1) Explicit multi-class modeling:** Include occluded and cropped as target classes as we train the network. The model will learn features indicative of occlusion (e.g. presence of a vehicle roof or a shadow) and of cropping (e.g. a straight image border cutting through the road). This has the benefit of directly predicting these conditions. The downside is it diverts model capacity to learn non-distress features. **(2) Two-stage filtering:** In this approach, we train a binary or tri-class model just for road condition (damaged vs undamaged vs maybe ambiguous) and separately build a detector for occlusion/crop. For instance, a simple computer vision filter could detect if the tile’s edge corresponds to an image border crossing the road (flagging cropped), or use an object detection model to spot vehicles and mark those tiles as occluded. Those tiles could then be skipped or flagged as needing human review. The multi-class network approach is simpler to implement within a single model. We will likely try that first – if the performance on “damaged” vs “undamaged” suffers due to the extra classes, we can reconsider. Notably, some research on pavement defect classification has treated obstructions as a separate category and successfully trained networks to recognize them ([Automated Road Defect and Anomaly Detection for Traffic Safety: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5656#:~:text=match%20at%20L2524%20shadow%2C%20occlusions%2C,merging%20long%2Fshort%20bump%20classes%20to)) ([Automated Road Defect and Anomaly Detection for Traffic Safety: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5656#:~:text=shadow%2C%20occlusions%2C%20and%20camera%20resolution,merging%20long%2Fshort%20bump%20classes%20to)), which suggests multi-class training is feasible.

**Incorporating Multi-Stage Pipeline:** A more **robust pipeline** can be designed by chaining specialized models for different tasks. One proposal is: **Stage 1 – Road Segmentation:** Use a model like SAM or a lightweight segmentation CNN to generate a mask of road pixels in each image (if not already provided). By applying this mask, we isolate the road surface. This can even be done per tile: for each segment, ensure we ignore non-road portions (e.g. sometimes a tile might only partially cover the road, especially near curves or intersections). Feeding the classifier only the road area (perhaps by zeroing out background in the tile) can reduce false positives from surrounding context. In Merkle *et al.*’s work, they added a branch with a “road mask” input to their U-Net, which notably **reduced false positives outside road areas** ([](https://elib.dlr.de/185780/1/ISPRS_Congress_2022___Full_Paper__Road_Condition_Assessment_final.pdf#:~:text=Figure%206,This%20can%20be%20seen%20in)) ([](https://elib.dlr.de/185780/1/ISPRS_Congress_2022___Full_Paper__Road_Condition_Assessment_final.pdf#:~:text=SkipFuse,This%20can%20be%20seen%20in)). Inspired by that, we can incorporate the road mask to inform our classifier or segmenter which pixels to focus on. **Stage 2 – Distress Classification or Detection:** After isolating roads, we apply the distress classifier to each road segment. Here we might introduce a **hybrid approach**: for example, use a segmentation model to detect cracks within the segment, and then classify the segment as damaged if the crack mask exceeds some threshold. A modern option is to leverage models like Mask R-CNN or U-Net directly on each tile to produce a pixel-wise prediction (crack pixels vs normal) ([A Deep Learning Framework for Segmentation of Road Defects ...](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3652037.3663935#:~:text=pixel,and%20potholes)). The output mask can then be aggregated (if any crack pixels detected, mark tile as damaged). This essentially converts the problem into semantic segmentation with three classes: crack, road, occlusion. However, training such a segmentation might require pixel labels which we may not have for all data. An alternative multi-stage pipeline could use **object detection for distress**: e.g. run a small YOLOv5 model on the tile to detect any pothole or crack region (as a bounding box), then if any detection is present, label tile as damaged. Recent YOLO-based solutions have shown high precision for detecting even small potholes ([RDD-YOLO: Road Damage Detection Algorithm Based on Improved ...](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/14/8/3360#:~:text=This%20paper%20introduces%20an%20enhanced,YOLO)) ([YOLO-RD: A Road Damage Detection Method for Effective ...](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11902777/#:~:text=,improvement%20in%20small%20object)). We could fine-tune a YOLO on our dataset if bounding box labels for damage are obtainable (perhaps via weak labels from segmentation or synthetic labeling).

**Aggregation to Road-Level Classification:** The ultimate goal is an overall condition per road (which spans multiple segments). We need to **aggregate segment-level predictions** to infer road-level condition. Several strategies can be tried: **Majority Voting** – classify a road as “damaged” if more than 50% of its segments are damaged. This might be too lenient, as even a single pothole might warrant the road being flagged. A stricter rule could be **“any damage = road damaged”**, which ensures high recall (catch any road with a defect) but could flag roads with one small crack the same as ones with many issues. A middle ground is to use a **weighted average or score**: for example, compute a road damage score = (number of damaged segments / number of visible segments). One could set a threshold like >20% segments damaged to call the road damaged. The weighting can also account for segment length – if segments are equal length slices of road, that’s fine, but if segmentation is uneven, longer segments might count more. Another clever method is an **adjacency-based smoothing**: if isolated segments are marked damaged but neighbors are fine, perhaps it was a false positive, whereas clusters of damaged segments indicate true distress. Using this intuition, one can perform a 1D smoothing along the sequence of segments that make up a road. For instance, require at least two consecutive segments labeled damaged to mark the road, or use a sliding window vote. Graphical models or conditional random fields could also be applied on the sequence of segments as nodes, encouraging contiguous segment labels to be consistent (though this might be overkill). 

In the case of **occluded or cropped segments**, how do we aggregate? If a road has many occluded segments (e.g. cars parked along most of it), our confidence in the road-level assessment drops. We might introduce an “uncertain” category for road-level status if >X% of the road is not observable. Otherwise, we treat occluded segments as simply not contributing to either damaged or undamaged count. For cropped segments (road edges), if they belong to a road that continues beyond the image, they might be excluded from analysis or combined with adjacent imagery if available. In summary, the aggregation will likely classify a road as **“damaged” if any significant portion is damaged**, using domain knowledge to set thresholds. This aligns with maintenance needs – even one severe pothole means the road isn’t fully healthy. For initial implementation, a conservative approach is: road is damaged if *at least one* segment is labeled damaged (and not contradicted by obvious errors). This ensures no damaged road slips by unflagged. We will evaluate and adjust this criterion on validation data.

**Spatial and Contextual Learning:** Rather than heuristic aggregation, one could train a model to predict road-level condition from all its segment data. For example, an **RNN or Transformer** that takes the sequence of segment features could directly output a road rating, inherently learning how multiple segments’ labels combine. Another approach is to use **segmentation on the entire road**: if we had a mask of cracks along the road length, we could compute features like total crack length or density and classify the road’s condition grade. While our task is categorical, it might be extended to a severity score. Some studies have proposed regression of crack density or length for road sections and then thresholding those for condition assessment ([](https://elib.dlr.de/185780/1/ISPRS_Congress_2022___Full_Paper__Road_Condition_Assessment_final.pdf#:~:text=image%20segmentation%20method%20capable%20of,INTRODUCTION)) ([](https://elib.dlr.de/185780/1/ISPRS_Congress_2022___Full_Paper__Road_Condition_Assessment_final.pdf#:~:text=imagery%2C%20namely%20cracks%20and%20working,condition%20assessment%20in%20the%20future)). We might incorporate such ideas if needed (e.g. count contiguous cracked segments as a measure of severity). Additionally, **spatial smoothing** can be applied at prediction time: treat neighboring segments on the same road as likely to have similar labels (except at a damage boundary). This could be implemented by a simple rule or by a CRF that encourages adjacent segments to share the same label unless evidence strongly suggests otherwise. This kind of spatial coherence prior can improve consistency of the results along a road.

Finally, exploring a **segmentation-based model** at the segment level: e.g. a U-Net that outputs a pixel-wise map of cracks within a segment (with a class for occlusion). If ground truth segmentation is not available, this could be done via weak labels – e.g. treat the classifier’s output as weak labels and refine them with an unsupervised method. Fully training a segmentation (with say crack pixels = 1, everything else = 0, and ignore occluded areas) could provide an elegant solution where the model both locates and classifies damage in one go. In fact, recent transformer-based segmentation models have been applied to pavement cracks (TransUNet, Swin-Unet) showing improved accuracy in delineating cracks ([[PDF] Detection of Pavement Cracks by Deep Learning Models of ... - arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.12596#:~:text=,Their)). Such a model could be adapted to our aerial context, potentially improving the identification of fine cracks by looking at the pixel level rather than just whole-tile features. We will weigh the complexity of this approach against the performance of simpler classifiers during development.

## Evaluation Strategy

**Segment-Level Evaluation:** At the segment (tile) level, we will use standard classification metrics. **Accuracy** gives an overall performance, but with imbalance it can be misleading (e.g. predicting all segments as “undamaged” might yield high accuracy if most segments are undamaged). Thus, **precision, recall, and F1-score** for each class are more informative. In particular, the damaged class is of high importance: we want a high recall (few false negatives, meaning we catch all actual damaged segments) while keeping precision reasonably high (not too many false alarms). We will compute a confusion matrix for the multi-class predictions to see where errors occur. For example, do damaged segments get misclassified as undamaged often, or are occluded segments frequently mistaken as undamaged? A confusion matrix can reveal such patterns. An example confusion matrix from a multi-class pavement defect classifier is shown below, illustrating per-class performance and error distribution:

 ([Automatic Pavement Defect Detection and Classification Using RGB-Thermal Images Based on Hierarchical Residual Attention Network](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/15/5781)) *Example confusion matrix from a pavement defect classification model (9 classes including multiple crack types, shadows, etc.) ([Automatic Pavement Defect Detection and Classification Using RGB-Thermal Images Based on Hierarchical Residual Attention Network](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/15/5781#:~:text=indicates%20a%20higher%20score%20for,alligator%2C%20longitudinal%20cracks%2C%20and%20transverse)) ([Automatic Pavement Defect Detection and Classification Using RGB-Thermal Images Based on Hierarchical Residual Attention Network](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/15/5781#:~:text=Figure%2011,CAM)). This kind of analysis helps identify confusion between classes (e.g. shadows vs cracks). In our case, we would expect a matrix to show if “damaged” vs “undamaged” are well-separated and whether “occluded” segments are being mistaken for undamaged or flagged correctly.*

From the confusion matrix and metrics, we will pay attention to specific failure modes: false negatives on damage (missed detections) are critical to minimize for safety reasons, while false positives (normal road marked damaged) waste maintenance effort but are less dire than misses. We might decide on a operating point that slightly favors recall (sensitivity) at segment level. **Precision-Recall curves** could be examined if we output confidence scores; for binary damaged/not-damaged we could vary a threshold to see the trade-off.

**Road-Level Evaluation:** Once segment predictions are aggregated into an overall road condition, we evaluate how well the pipeline classifies each road. If the road-level classification is binary (damaged road vs undamaged road), we can use metrics similar to above (accuracy, precision, recall, F1 at the road level). In validation, each road can be labeled “truly has damage” (if any segment in ground truth was damaged) vs “truly no damage.” We will compare our aggregated predictions to these truths. We expect the road-level recall to potentially exceed segment-level (since any segment triggers the road), but we need to ensure precision doesn’t plummet (flagging every road due to spurious segment detections). If the road-level classification has more categories (for instance, one could define “partially occluded” as a road-level status), we would adjust metrics accordingly. However, likely it’s binary or a graded scale of condition. We will also consider a **road-level confusion matrix** if multiple condition grades are used.

**Cross-Validation and Testing:** Given the complexity, we will utilize cross-validation during development. We can perform a *k-fold cross-validation* on the training set at the road level (ensuring each fold has distinct roads) to gauge variability and avoid overfitting on one split. This yields more reliable estimates of performance and helps in model selection (e.g. choosing hyperparameters or architectures that generalize). After iterating with cross-val, we will do a final evaluation on a held-out test set of roads that were never used in training or validation. This final test mimics deploying the model on entirely new areas. We anticipate some drop in performance if the new area has distribution shifts (different camera, region, etc.), but it will quantify generalization.

**Interpretability & Error Analysis:** Interpreting the model’s decisions is important both for trust and for diagnosing errors. We will use **Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)** or related visualization tools on our CNN classifiers ([Automatic Pavement Defect Detection and Classification Using RGB-Thermal Images Based on Hierarchical Residual Attention Network](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/15/5781#:~:text=model%20has%20fewer%20parameters%2C%20shorter,images%20under%20different%20input%20data)) ([Automatic Pavement Defect Detection and Classification Using RGB-Thermal Images Based on Hierarchical Residual Attention Network](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/15/5781#:~:text=method%20incorporating%20gradient,images%20under%20different%20input%20data)). Grad-CAM produces a heatmap highlighting which image regions influenced the model’s prediction. By overlaying this on road segment images, we can see if the model is focusing on actual cracks or on irrelevant features. For instance, if an “undamaged” prediction’s Grad-CAM highlights the clean road texture, that’s expected, but if a “damaged” prediction’s heatmap highlights a shadow edge instead of the faint crack nearby, the model might be misled by the shadow. Prior work demonstrated Grad-CAM on road defect models can pinpoint the areas of potholes or oil stains that the model learned ([Automatic Pavement Defect Detection and Classification Using RGB-Thermal Images Based on Hierarchical Residual Attention Network](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/15/5781#:~:text=indicates%20a%20higher%20score%20for,alligator%2C%20longitudinal%20cracks%2C%20and%20transverse)). We will generate such visualizations for a sample of segments in each class. Particularly, look at occluded segments: does the model highlight the occluding object (meaning it correctly recognizes occlusion), or does it mistakenly highlight some artifact as a crack? This guides us in refining the approach (maybe we need to explicitly mask non-road objects). 

Beyond Grad-CAM, if we use a segmentation approach, visualizing the predicted masks overlaid on the image is the natural way to interpret results – we will do that to verify that crack pixels align with actual cracks. We will also analyze **failure cases** explicitly: collect all segments where the model was wrong (especially damaged segments predicted as undamaged and vice versa). By examining these, we might notice patterns: e.g. “most missed damaged segments were hairline cracks under low contrast” or “many false damaged were actually tar seal lines that were misidentified.” This feedback loop informs data augmentation or model tweaks (for example, if tar strips are causing false positives, we might include some examples of tar strips in “undamaged” class in training or augment with similar patterns to teach the model the difference).

**Metrics for Occlusion/Crop Handling:** If occluded/cropped are in our label set, we will also evaluate those predictions. An occluded segment prediction isn’t about a “false positive” in the usual sense – if the model says “occluded” and indeed a car was covering it, that’s a true positive for occlusion. We will measure the precision/recall for occlusion class to see if the model is properly detecting obstructions. If recall on occlusion is low, the pipeline might be assuming undamaged when it actually couldn’t see, which is problematic. So we want the model to err on the side of marking occlusion when in doubt. This could be tuned by adjusting the model’s threshold for occlusion class or adding a rule: for example, any segment with >N% mask of non-road object could be auto-labeled occluded.

**Ablation Studies:** To identify the contribution of each component, we will perform ablation experiments. One key ablation is **including vs. excluding occlusion/crop classes**: train one model with all 4 classes, and another model where occluded/cropped segments are removed or labeled as “undamaged” (simulate ignoring them). Comparing these will show if explicit occlusion classes improve performance on the main damaged/undamaged classification. We hypothesize that explicitly modeling occlusion helps the model not confuse occluded as undamaged, thereby improving damaged vs undamaged discrimination (because otherwise occluded segments might erroneously count as undamaged). We will verify this by looking at damage recall in both scenarios. Another ablation is the **multi-stage vs single-stage** approach: for example, compare a direct classifier on tiles to a pipeline where we first apply a road mask or run a crack segmentation then classify. If using a road mask input, we can test the effect by training one model with the mask (like an extra input channel or as separate branch) and one without. The DLR study found adding a road mask reduced off-road false positives ([](https://elib.dlr.de/185780/1/ISPRS_Congress_2022___Full_Paper__Road_Condition_Assessment_final.pdf#:~:text=Figure%206,This%20can%20be%20seen%20in)) – we can see if it holds in our case by measuring precision (false positive rate) with and without it. Similarly, if we implement a crack segmentation model, we can compare its derived segment classification to our original classifier’s results. Metrics like IoU (Intersection-over-Union) for crack segmentation can be used if ground truth masks are available or approximated. 

We will also evaluate the **aggregation method**: for instance, does majority voting vs “any damage triggers road damaged” change our road-level precision/recall significantly? This could be done on validation sets to choose a policy that maximizes a desired metric (perhaps F1 or recall). If we have enough roads, a small **user study or expert review** could also be part of evaluation – e.g. have a road engineer review the roads our model flagged vs not flagged, to see if they agree. This kind of qualitative evaluation ensures the model’s output aligns with real maintenance priorities, beyond just numeric metrics.

## Extensions & Advanced Topics

**Spatio-Temporal Analysis:** If the dataset includes multiple time points (e.g. periodic aerial surveys of the same roads), we can leverage temporal information. Roads deteriorate over time, so a sequence of images can reveal emerging cracks. A spatio-temporal model could track changes – for example, use a recurrent neural network or 3D CNN that takes as input a time series of images for the same road segment and outputs the current condition. This can improve robustness: an anomaly that appears in one frame but disappears (e.g. a temporary wet spot) can be ignored if the model learns consistency over time. Another approach is **change detection**: compare a current image to a past “baseline” image of the road. Subtracting images (after proper alignment) can highlight new cracks or potholes as differences. Traditional methods for change detection or modern deep unsupervised methods (like training a Siamese network to detect differences) could be applied. For instance, for post-disaster damage mapping, before/after image comparisons are common ([
Segment-anything embedding for pixel-level road damage extraction using high-resolution satellite images – DOAJ](https://doaj.org/article/685634315fba4490b5cee0fed97c185c#:~:text=When%20a%20strong%20earthquake%20occurs%2C,resolution)). In our maintenance context, periodic flights (say yearly) could yield data to train a model that predicts where new damage likely occurred. Time-series analysis can also help predict future condition – if we have several time points, we could attempt to **forecast road degradation**, though that veers into predictive maintenance beyond immediate classification.

**Active Learning for Annotation:** Labeling aerial images for road damage is labor-intensive. An **active learning** approach can make this more efficient. We could deploy an initial model to scan unlabeled (or newly collected) images and have it flag segments with low confidence or suspected damage. Human annotators would then review these specific segments – either confirm damage or correct the label. Those newly labeled hard examples would be added to the training set for the next model iteration. Over time, the model focuses on learning from the most informative samples (often the edge cases like very faint cracks or confusing shadows). This human-in-the-loop strategy can rapidly improve performance with minimal additional labeling, which is practical for municipal uses where new data keeps coming. We can also use active learning to handle **domain shifts**: if the model is rolled out in a new city, an annotator can verify a small set of results, and the model retrains on those to adapt. Additionally, an interface can be built for inspectors to correct model output (say, on a map, flip a segment label if wrong), and those corrections feed back into improving the model.

**Transfer Learning & Pretraining:** Transfer learning is essential given relatively limited domain data. Aside from ImageNet pretraining (which gives generic feature detectors for textures, edges, etc.), we can explore pretraining on **geospatial datasets**. There are large aerial image datasets for tasks like building detection, road extraction, land cover classification (e.g. DeepGlobe, SpaceNet). A model backbone pretrained on aerial imagery might already be attuned to the visual characteristics of overhead data (certain color distributions, shadow patterns) better than one pretrained on everyday objects. Moreover, we could pretrain on synthetic data: for example, render pavement images with cracks via simulation or use GANs to generate crack images to enrich training ([USSC-YOLO: Enhanced Multi-Scale Road Crack Object Detection Algorithm for UAV Image](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/17/5586#:~:text=While%20progress%20has%20been%20made,model%20that%20can%20accurately%20detect)). Another form of transfer is using **foundation models**: SAM, as mentioned, was used to aid segmentation ([
Segment-anything embedding for pixel-level road damage extraction using high-resolution satellite images – DOAJ](https://doaj.org/article/685634315fba4490b5cee0fed97c185c#:~:text=application%20of%20a%20pre,models%20for%20downstream%20remote%20sensing)). One could also use CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) models by treating road damage detection as an image similarity problem (though this is unconventional, e.g. embedding images and seeing if they are closer to “cracked road” text embedding vs “intact road”). More straightforward is leveraging existing **road damage datasets** from other sources: for example, the “Road Damage Detection (RDD) challenge datasets” which contain thousands of street-level images of cracks and potholes from multiple countries ([RDD2022: A multi‐national image dataset for automatic road ...](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/gdj3.260?af=R#:~:text=RDD2022%3A%20A%20multi%E2%80%90national%20image%20dataset,supports%20direct%20use%20for)). While the perspective is different, the visual of a crack may be similar; we might use those images to pretrain a crack/not-crack classifier and then fine-tune on aerial perspective. Similarly, any available **drone imagery dataset** for pavement (such as the UNFSRCI dataset used in the USSC-YOLO paper ([USSC-YOLO: Enhanced Multi-Scale Road Crack Object Detection Algorithm for UAV Image](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/24/17/5586#:~:text=,crack%20characteristics%20by%20neural%20networks))) could provide additional training data or pretraining for our model. 

**Integration in Workflows:** For deployment, consider how this pipeline fits into existing **drone-based or municipal road survey workflows**. One scenario is a **drone patrol**: a drone flies along a road, capturing video or images of segments. The model could be run in near real-time on the drone or on a connected edge device to flag distress. Running on-board requires an efficient model (we might use the efficient classifier or even a smaller model distilled from the main one). A real-time system could alert the drone operator or city engineers immediately when a road section is damaged, possibly allowing on-site confirmation (the drone could hover and take a closer look if needed). Another pathway is integration into a **GIS (Geographic Information System)**. The outputs (road-level condition) can be mapped, producing a visual layer of road health (color-coded roads by condition). Many municipalities use pavement management systems where they input survey data and schedule repairs. Our pipeline could automate data input by producing a list of road segments with issues and severity estimates. We should ensure the output format is compatible – e.g. output a geo-referenced shapefile or GeoJSON with each road polyline tagged as damaged/undamaged. Tools like ArcGIS can be used to combine this with other data (traffic counts, etc. for prioritization) ([Automate Road Surface Investigation Using Deep Learning](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/latest/samples/automate-road-surface-investigation-using-deep-learning/#:~:text=Automate%20Road%20Surface%20Investigation%20Using,integrate%20with%20ArcGIS%20as)).

Deployment might also consider **cloud vs edge**. For city-wide analysis, it could be feasible to upload imagery to a cloud server where a powerful GPU farm runs the model and returns results. If using satellite imagery, the images might already be in cloud databases (like Google Earth Engine) where analysis can be scaled. However, for immediate results or privacy reasons, an **on-premise system** could be used by the municipality. They would need a workstation with a good GPU to run the models on new imagery. If the workflow involves repeated analysis (e.g. quarterly drone flights), we must ensure the pipeline is automated: from image input -> tiling -> inference -> aggregation -> report generation, with minimal manual steps. This could be implemented as a pipeline script or using a tool like Detectron2 or TensorFlow pipelines.

**Potential Improvements:** We can consider advanced model improvements like **ensemble learning** – combining a segmentation model and a classification model, or two classifiers with different architectures (e.g. ResNet and EfficientNet) and averaging their outputs to reduce variance. Ensembling often boosts accuracy in competitions, though at the cost of speed ([Automated Road Defect and Anomaly Detection for Traffic Safety: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5656#:~:text=a%20powerful%20approach%20for%20object,out%20of%2032K%20images)) ([Automated Road Defect and Anomaly Detection for Traffic Safety: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5656#:~:text=approach%2C%20which%20identifies%20and%20binds,improve%20road%20safety%20and%20maintenance)). If ultimate accuracy is needed and inference time is not critical, an ensemble could be worthwhile. Another extension is to incorporate **multi-modal data** if available: for example, some aerial surveys might have an infrared channel or LiDAR depth data. Thermal imaging has been used to detect subsurface moisture which correlates with potholes ([Automated Road Defect and Anomaly Detection for Traffic Safety: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5656#:~:text=The%20pixel%20segmentation%20method%20for,are%20divided%20into%20decoder%20and)). If our dataset had such modalities, a multi-modal network could be designed (early or late fusion of features) to exploit that. 

Lastly, consider **scalability and cloud deployment**: If analyzing an entire city’s roads from aerial imagery, the volume of data is huge. Using cloud computing with parallel processing on image tiles would speed it up. We might containerize the model (e.g. in a Docker container) and deploy on a cloud service with GPUs. We should also store results in a database for trend analysis (this ties back to temporal analysis – over years we can see how many new damaged roads appear, etc.). All these extensions ensure the pipeline is not just a one-off model but a sustainable system integrated into maintenance operations.

## Project Management & Timeline

Developing this road distress classification pipeline will be organized into clear milestones:

- **Milestone 1: Data Familiarization (Week 1-2).** In this phase, the team will ingest the provided dataset and perform the exploratory analysis discussed. We will generate summary stats (number of images, segments, class distribution ([Automated Road Defect and Anomaly Detection for Traffic Safety: A Systematic Review](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/12/5656#:~:text=Limitations%3A%20The%20small%20size%20of,14%20Road%20infrastructure%20defect%20dataset))) and visualize examples of each class. Any data issues (corrupt images, mislabels) will be logged. By the end of Week 2, we expect a **data quality report** and a refined labeling guideline (making sure everyone on the team interprets “occluded” vs “cropped” consistently).

- **Milestone 2: Setup and Baseline Model (Week 3-4).** This involves setting up the development environment (ensuring we have GPU access, installing deep learning frameworks) and writing data preprocessing code to tile images and apply augmentations. We will then train a baseline CNN classifier (e.g. ResNet50) on the training set. This includes tuning it quickly (maybe a few epochs to see initial learning). By end of Week 4, we should have baseline results on validation – e.g. “X% accuracy, Y% recall for damaged.” Also by this time, we should have established a reasonable train/val/test split (roads list for each set) and possibly done one round of cross-validation to sanity-check performance variance.

- **Milestone 3: Error Analysis & Model Refinement (Week 5-6).** With a baseline in hand, we dive into where it fails. We’ll generate confusion matrices and Grad-CAM visualizations. Suppose we find the model often misses thin cracks or confuses shadows as damage – we then refine accordingly. This could mean augmenting more (e.g. adding shadow simulation), or adjusting the model (like adding an attention mechanism to focus on finer details ([Automatic Pavement Defect Detection and Classification Using RGB-Thermal Images Based on Hierarchical Residual Attention Network](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/15/5781#:~:text=proposed%20to%20implement%20a%20lightweight,training%20time%2C%20and%20higher%20recognition)) ([Automatic Pavement Defect Detection and Classification Using RGB-Thermal Images Based on Hierarchical Residual Attention Network](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/15/5781#:~:text=method%20incorporating%20gradient,images%20under%20different%20input%20data))). We might try a more advanced architecture (EfficientNet or a Vision Transformer-based model) if baseline is not satisfactory. This stage may also involve incorporating the road mask into the model input to reduce false positives outside roads. By mid Week 6, we aim to have an **improved model checkpoint** with better metrics than baseline.

- **Milestone 4: Multi-Stage Pipeline Implementation (Week 7-8).** Here we integrate additional stages like a crack segmentation model or an object detector for validation. For example, we might train a U-Net on a small manually labeled subset to see how well it segments cracks, and compare that with classifier results. We also implement the aggregation logic to produce road-level decisions. By end of Week 8, we should have a prototype end-to-end pipeline: input an image (or set of segments for a road), output the road condition. We will test this pipeline on validation data (maybe choose a couple of roads and go through the whole process to ensure it works).

- **Milestone 5: Evaluation & Ablation Study (Week 9).** In this week, we rigorously evaluate the pipeline. We run it on the full validation set (or perform cross-val if needed) and compute all metrics. We also conduct the planned ablation experiments: e.g. retrain a model without occlusion classes to compare. We’ll compile results in tables for segment-level and road-level performance. We may also generate some qualitative results (visualizations of segmented cracks, Grad-CAM heatmaps on a few examples) to include in the final report or to demonstrate to stakeholders. By the end of Week 9, we should have a clear picture of how each design choice affects performance.

- **Milestone 6: Final Testing and Documentation (Week 10).** Using the held-out test set of roads, we do one final run to report the expected real-world performance. We ensure that no information from these roads was used in training. At this stage, we will also finalize documentation: the methodology, how to run the pipeline, and guidance on interpreting output. We’ll prepare a **final report** (which this document would form the basis of) and possibly a presentation for stakeholders. If time permits, we may also incorporate any feedback from earlier milestones (for instance, if a city engineer had early access to some results and had suggestions, we would address them now).

Throughout these milestones, **hardware considerations** are kept in mind. Training CNNs or Transformers on high-resolution images can be GPU-intensive. We plan to use a GPU (such as an NVIDIA Tesla or RTX with at least 12GB memory) for training. If multiple GPUs are available, we can parallelize experiments (e.g. run cross-val folds concurrently, or train separate ablation models in parallel). During Milestone 2-4, having at least one powerful GPU is critical for model development iterations. In later stages, CPU might suffice for running the final pipeline on small batches of new images, but a GPU will always speed up inference. We will also utilize mixed precision training if possible to accelerate and save memory.

For **annotation tools and formats**, since our data is pre-labeled, we might not need extensive manual labeling. But if adjustments or additional labels are needed (say we decide to label 50 images with crack masks to train a segmentation model), we would use a tool like **Labelme or CVAT** for drawing crack polygons/lines. These annotations would be saved in a format (JSON or XML) that our training code can read to generate masks. We’ll maintain a consistent directory structure for images and labels, possibly adopting a COCO-style JSON for any segmentation labels. Also, for managing data splits and multiple experiments, we’ll use configuration files or notebooks that record which roads are in train/val/test to avoid mix-ups.

**Milestone 7: Deployment Preparation (Week 11-12, overlapping):** While not explicitly requested, if deployment is a goal, in parallel to evaluation we might start packaging the model. This includes writing inference scripts that can take new aerial imagery, apply the same preprocessing (tiling, masking), load the trained model weights, and output predictions. We would test this on a small scale (maybe simulate a new image or use part of test set) to ensure the pipeline is automated. We’ll also consider optimizations like converting the model to TorchScript or ONNX for faster inference, and possibly quantization if running on edge devices. By project end, we’d deliver not just the model but also a **user guide** for running it on new data.

This timeline is approximate and some tasks can overlap (e.g. while one team member works on modeling, another can work on the GIS integration or data augmentation scripts). Regular meetings will track progress and we’ll adjust if some parts take longer (for example, if the baseline model needs more tweaking, it might extend into week 5, and we then compress evaluation time accordingly).

## Open Questions

**Occlusion/Cropped Segment Handling:** A key design question remains: how to ultimately handle segments where the road is not fully visible. If our model classifies a segment as “occluded,” what do we do with that information? One approach is to treat “occluded” as essentially *unknown* condition for that segment. When aggregating to road-level, if a small fraction of segments are occluded, we might ignore them (assuming the rest of the road tells the story). But if a large fraction are occluded, we might report the road condition as uncertain. We should decide on a policy, perhaps in consultation with stakeholders. If the end-users (e.g. city engineers) prefer false alarms to uncertainty, we might choose to classify a road as damaged if we cannot see large parts of it (assuming worst-case). On the other hand, if resources are limited, we don’t want to cry wolf for every occluded stretch. A balanced approach: mark road as needing **manual inspection** if >30% is occluded, for example, rather than automatically calling it good or bad. This open question of thresholding and interpretation of occlusions will need to be settled with domain input. Likewise, for cropped segments – if a road extends beyond the image, do we treat that road as only partially analyzed? In a production system, we might merge adjacent images or have an overlap so roads aren’t cut off. But if not, we should flag roads that were not fully captured (so decision makers know the analysis was partial).

**Generalization Across Geographies:** Roads in different regions can have very different characteristics (material, construction standards, typical distress types, climate impacts). A model trained on one city’s roads might not directly work on another’s. Will our pipeline generalize to, say, both a dry Arizona highway (with sunbaked longitudinal cracks) and a wet northern city (with potholes from freeze-thaw)? We aim to make the model robust via diverse training data and augmentation (simulating various conditions), but there may still be biases. For instance, if all training images had dark asphalt, the model might struggle on light concrete roads. We might address this by color normalization or style transfer. Another aspect is **climate and wear patterns**: some regions have mostly alligator cracking, others have long transverse cracks – the model might underperform if a damage type was absent in training. Continual learning or fine-tuning on a small sample from the new region can help (related to transfer learning above). This question will likely remain open until tested – so it’s wise to design the system to be adaptable (able to incorporate a few new labels and retrain) rather than assuming one static model fits all. Additionally, differences in imaging (one city might use a different camera or altitude) can affect resolution. If the GSD (ground sampling distance) is coarser in a new dataset, the model might miss fine cracks – we’d need to adjust expectations or retrain with downsampled images to teach the model to handle that. In summary, we should keep an eye on domain shifts and plan for a phase of calibration whenever the pipeline is applied to a new geography.

**Stakeholder Collaboration:** Throughout the project, collaboration with end-users (such as municipal road management teams) is beneficial. They can provide insights like: what size of crack is considered “damage” that warrants repair? (Some hairline cracks might be considered minor and not in need of reporting – if so, the definition of “damaged” segment may need to align with a crack width threshold). They can also help validate results in the field – after we analyze a road, an engineer could confirm if that road indeed needs maintenance. This feedback would be invaluable for refining our model thresholds or labels (maybe our “undamaged” vs “damaged” needs to correspond to their “good vs fair vs poor” condition rating). An open question is how to integrate such domain knowledge. We might incorporate a simple rule-based layer after the model – for example, if a crack is shorter than X meters, perhaps it’s negligible. But quantifying that from aerial imagery alone can be tricky. Another area for stakeholder input is **priority weighting**: if certain types of distress (say, potholes) are more urgent than longitudinal cracks, we might train separate detectors or at least ensure the model is very sensitive to potholes. The current formulation doesn’t distinguish distress type, but the literature shows many models do classify crack types ([

        ](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11466381/#:~:text=images%20with%20anomalous%20conditions,represents%20the%20core%20process%20for)). We chose a simpler binary damaged vs not, but a possible extension (if stakeholders desire) is to categorize the type of damage (alligator cracking vs pothole, etc.) using a multi-label model. This would involve more annotation effort. We will keep this option open, perhaps by leveraging known datasets like RDD (which label crack types) to see if our model could do it. 

**Ethical and Sustainability Considerations:** Using aerial imagery raises some ethical questions, primarily **privacy**. While our focus is on roads, aerial images might incidentally capture people in yards, license plates, etc. Our model does not need that information, so ideally the data should be pre-processed to blur or crop out non-road regions (which the road mask approach would naturally do). Ensuring that any deployment respects privacy laws (for instance, some jurisdictions treat low-altitude drone imagery as sensitive data) is important – perhaps obtaining proper clearance for data collection and limiting use to road assessment only. From a sustainability perspective, there are trade-offs. Frequent aerial surveys (drones or planes) consume energy and have a carbon footprint. But they might replace manual patrols that are less efficient. If using drones, electric UAVs have a relatively low environmental impact, but their batteries need charging. Perhaps one could optimize flight paths or frequency (maybe quarterly flights instead of monthly if the model can reliably predict deterioration in between). The computational aspect is another consideration – training large deep models is energy-intensive (GPUs running for days). We mitigated this by choosing reasonably efficient architectures and using transfer learning (so training is not from scratch each time). Once trained, inference is relatively lightweight, especially if we compress the model. We could also use cloud servers that are carbon-neutral or schedule training during off-peak energy hours. Another ethical point: if the system is deployed, it should not lead to **negligence of human inspection entirely**. There’s a risk that authorities over-trust the AI and ignore obvious issues it might miss. We recommend the pipeline as a *decision support tool*, not a replacement for all inspections. It can drastically reduce the workload by highlighting likely problem areas, but a human should verify critical decisions (especially if the model flags a road as “fine” but perhaps it hasn’t seen a subtle issue). 

**Future Work and Questions:** Some open questions will remain at project end. For example, how to handle **new distress types** that were not in training data? (E.g., the model knows about cracks and patches, but what if a landslide or sinkhole damages a road – would it detect it as “damaged”? Likely yes if visual disturbance is large, but type-specific models might be needed for unusual cases.) Can the model estimate the **severity** or remaining life of the road? That goes beyond classification into a predictive maintenance realm. While not our current scope, these questions could guide future enhancements, such as integrating traffic data to predict how quickly an observed crack will expand.

In conclusion, the development of the road distress classification pipeline is guided by current best practices in deep learning for vision, tailored to aerial road imagery, and tempered by practical considerations of real-world use. By iterating with thorough evaluation and keeping communication open with domain experts, we aim to deliver a tool that is accurate, reliable, and ready to assist in maintaining safer roads.
